# Best & simple PHP API Router
## API-Routing for PHP. Code any API in PHP with less effort.

You do not have to switch to Node, Express.js, Python or Go to create a industry-standard API routing.

Just use the open source framework php-baapi to create easy API routes that other developers love in other programming languages.

Instead of methods, we use simple if statements.

## How to define routes:
  
  Please go to the routes.php file and define your API routes there.
  
  Also you can place any other php file into this directory where you add
  more routes for a specific topic.

  For example `sms.php` for SMS specific API routes, or `language.php` for
  the translation of language.
  
  DON'T place other php files into this directory, because all php files that
  you place into this folder will be executed to find the requtested API route.
  
  Here is an example of how to define routes in the routes.php file:
  
  Simple Route without parameter:
  -------------------------------

  **Hello World** API call:

  ```if (route("/hello", GET)) {
     echo json_encode(["message" => "Hello, World!"]);
  }
  ```

  **Say *Hello* to a specific x-being**
  ```if (route("/hello/{name}", "GET", $params)) {
    echo json_encode(["message" => "Hello, ".$params[0]."!"]);
    exit;
  }
  ```
  
  Route with parameter:
  ---------------------
  
  ```if (route("/user/{id}", GET, $params)) {
     // $arParams is an array that contains the api parameter (here the value of the passed-over {id}).
    echo json_encode(["user_id" => $params[0]]);
    exit;
  }
  ```

  A more advanced route could be:
  -------------------------------

  if ( route("/customer/create/{id}/{name}/as/vip", PUT, $params) ) {
    // Creates a customer with the `vip` option.
    echo json_encode(["message" => "Customer " . $params[0] . " with Name ". $params[1]." was created as VIP."]);
    exit;
  }


## How to test & call the routes:

  Just use CURL from your commandline:
  ```curl -X GET http://your-website.com/api/v1/hello/Urs+Langmeier -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
  ```

  If you need additional debug information use the -i option (shows the HTTP-Request Header):
  ```curl -X GET https://your-server.name/api/v1/hello/Urs+Langmeier -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" -i
  ```
    
## Installation

### üìå Apache

If you use Apache, the `.htaccess` file is already working in /api/v1/. No additional steps are necessairy to install and setup BAAPI.

```RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Nginx ‚Äì location Block

    If you are using Nginx, you can define the forwarding with location blocks in your server configuration.

    #### üìå Nginx Config (/etc/nginx/sites-available/default)

    ```server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;
    
        location /api/v2/ {
            rewrite ^/api/v2/(.*)$ /api/v2/index.php last;
        }
    
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;  # Anpassen je nach PHP-Version
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    **What‚Äôs happening here?**

    - All requests under `/api/v1/` are forwarded to `index.php`.  
    - PHP files are processed via `fastcgi_pass`.
    
    1. **Restart Nginx:**
    
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart nginx
       ```
    
    2. Call your api with `http://your-domain.com/api/v2/hello`

### Adding the site to XAMPP for Windows

If you use XAMPP for Windows, you may use `xampp-create-vhost.bat` and start it with Admin privileges
to setup the test site in XAMPP.
